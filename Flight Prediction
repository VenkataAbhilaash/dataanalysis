# Introduction

This semester we will be working with a dataset of all domestic outbound flights from Dulles International Airport in 2016.

Airports depend on accurate flight departure and arrival estimates to maintain operations, profitability, customer satisfaction, and compliance with state and federal laws. Flight performance, including departure and arrival delays must be monitored, submitted to the Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) on a regular basis, and minimized to maintain airport operations. **The FAA considered a flight to be delayed if it has an arrival delay of at least 15 minutes**.

The executives at Dulles International Airport have hired you as a Data Science consultant to perform an exploratory data analysis on all domestic flights from 2016 and produce an executive summary of your key insights and recommendations to the executive team.

Before you begin, take a moment to read through the following airline flight terminology to familiarize yourself with the industry: [Airline Flight Terms](https://www.myairlineflight.com)



## Dulles Flights Data

The `flights_df` data frame is loaded below and consists of 33,433 flights from IAD (Dulles International) in 2016. The rows in this data frame represent a single flight with all of the associated features that are displayed in the table below.

**Note**: If you have not installed the `tidyverse` package, please do so by going to the `Packages` tab in the lower right section of RStudio, select the `Install` button and type `tidyverse` into the prompt. If you cannot load the data, then try downloading the latest version of R (at least 4.0). The `readRDS()` function has different behavior in older versions of `R` and may cause loading issues.



```{r}

library(tidyverse)

flights_df <- readRDS(url('https://gmubusinessanalytics.netlify.app/data/dulles_flights.rds'))
# I have created another dataset delay_df with dep_delay greater than 15,I considered this because the flight delay of 15 minutes is acceptable.
delay_df<-flights_df[flights_df$dep_delay>15,]

```


### Raw Data

```{r}

# Exploratory Data Analysis


Executives at this company have hired you as a data science consultant to evaluate their flight data and make recommendations on flight operations and strategies for minimizing flight delays.

You must think of **at least 8 relevant questions** that will provide evidence for your recommendations.

The goal of your analysis should be discovering which variables drive the differences between flights that are early/on-time vs. flights that are delayed.

Some of the many questions you can explore include:

-   Are flight delays affected by taxi-out time? Do certain airlines or time of 
    year lead to greater taxi out times (i.e. traffic jams on the runways)?

-   Are certain times of the day or year problematic?

-   Are certain destination or airlines prone to delays?


You must answer each question and provide supporting data summaries with either a summary data frame (using `dplyr`/`tidyr`) or a plot (using `ggplot`) or both.

In total, you must have a minimum of 5 plots and 4 summary data frames for the exploratory data analysis section. Among the plots you produce, you must have at least 4 different types (ex. box plot, bar chart,
histogram, heat map, etc...)

Each question must be answered with supporting evidence from your tables and plots.


## Question 1



**Question**:

Does weekend's have an effect on the arrival delay time?

**Answer**:

I assumed that on weekends the delay will be greater but after performing EDA my hypothesis was proved wrong because I came to know that these are the most effective times in terms of minimizing the delays and Thursday has the greatest arrival delay and the least being Friday.

To add additional R code chunks for your work, select `Insert` then `R` from the top of this notebook file.

```{r}
average_delay<-delay_df %>% select(arrival_delay,weekday) %>% group_by(weekday) %>% summarize(median(arrival_delay))

View(average_delay)



```



## Question 2


**Question**:

Are certain destinations and airlines prone to delays?

**Answer**:

Minneapolis-St Paul of SkyWest Airline has the highest delay which I have obtained in the airline(data frame) and the Portland Jetport of United Airline has an average of 64.00000000 is the most delayed destination that was prone to delays.



```{r}

airline <-flights_df  %>% group_by(dest_airport_name,airline) %>% summarize(dep_delay=max(dep_delay))

avg_airline <-flights_df  %>% group_by(dest_airport_name,airline) %>% summarize(avg1=mean(dep_delay)) %>% arrange(desc(avg1))


```



## Question 3



**Question**:

How do departure delays vary with the month?

**Answer**:

While Answering the question the first thing we have to consider is whether we should focus on mean or median for the evaluation for which I have taken Boxplot for consideration and came to a conclusion that we have to follow the mean because there the data is more closer. Departure Delays vary by month and July has the highest departure delay and November has the least.



```{r}

mdelay<-delay_df %>% group_by(month) %>% summarize(md=mean(dep_delay)) %>% arrange(desc(md))
  
mdelay1<-delay_df %>% group_by(month) %>% summarize(md1=median(dep_delay)) %>% arrange(desc(md1))

mdelay1

ggplot(delay_df)+geom_boxplot(aes(x=month,y=dep_delay))


```




## Question 4


**Question**:

From which region at IAD airport has better ontime for departed flights?

**Answer**:

South Region has the better ontime for departed flights which I have done from the dep_delay column and categorized them as OnTime and Delayed and used that data frame to work on and found that SOuth has the highest onTime and SouthWest has the least.


```{r}

q4_df<-flights_df %>% mutate(dep_name=ifelse(dep_delay<15,"OnTime","Delayed"))
ontime_departure<- q4_df %>% group_by(dest_airport_region) %>% summarize(ontime=sum(dep_name=='OnTime')/n()) %>% arrange(desc(ontime))
ggplot(q4_df)+geom_bar(aes(dest_airport_city,fill=dep_name))


```




## Question 5


**Question**:

Are flight delays affected by taxi-out time? Do certain airlines or times of 
    year lead to greater taxi-out times

**Answer**:

From the scatterplot we cant observe any proper evidence to state that the taxi_out time has an effect on flight delays the graph is neither linear nor non-linear to judge.



```{r}
ggplot(delay_df)+geom_point(aes(dep_delay,taxi_out))
```


## Question 6



**Question**:

Most Used Airline?

**Answer**:

When it comes to the Airline the most used one tends to be the United Airlines though it is the most delayed airline people are choosing this the reasons may be the availability and cost of the ticket may be less for these airlines.

```{r}

q6 <- flights_df %>% group_by(airline) %>% summarize(count=n())


```


## Question 7


**Question**:

Is there any particular destination that tends to be visited more from the IAD airport?

**Answer**:

SanFransisco is the destination airport that tended to be the most visited airport city from IAD.



```{r}

q7<-flights_df %>% group_by(dest_airport_city) %>% summarize(totalflights=n()) %>% top_n(5)
ggplot(q7)+geom_col(aes(dest_airport_city,totalflights,fill=c("#eb8060", "#b9e38d", "#a1e9f0", "#d9b1f0","#c1d2e6")))+theme(legend.position='none')


```



## Question 8


**Question**

Find the top three flight numbers delayed the most?

**Answer**:

Flight Number 1972 of United Airlines delayed the most with the count of 95 and the next following flight was flight number 356 of JetBlue and third 822 of United delayed the most.



```{r}

most_delayed_flight<-delay_df %>% group_by(flight_num,airline) %>% summarize(count=n()) %>% arrange(desc(count)) %>% top_n(20)


```

     -You must also describe the potential business impact of your recommendation:

     -Why is this a good recommendation?

    - What benefits will the business achieve?
      


## Executive Summary

Please write your executive summary below. If you prefer, you can type your summary in a text editor, such as Microsoft Word, and paste your final text here.


Business Goal:  The goal of this business is to search for an alternative that minimizes the delay of departed flights and implements them effectively for the benefit of the company.

The goal of my analysis is to identify the requirements that have to be kept in place in order to mitigate the delays and increase the company’s productivity I have formulated eight  questions and have come to some conclusions based on that.

Questions I have developed?
1. Does weekends have an effect on the arrival delay time?
2.  Are certain destinations and airlines prone to delays?
3.  How do departure delays vary with the month?
4.  From which region at IAD airport has better ontime for departed flights?
5.  Are flight delays affected by taxi-out time? Do certain airlines or times of 
    year lead to greater taxi-out times

6.  Most Used Airline?
7.  Is there any particular destination that tends to be visited more from the IAD airport?
8.  Find the top three flight numbers delayed the most?

Recommendations:

a)Generally we think that weekends are the times when most delays get caused but the answer is different the days in which there is less movement in a crowd cause great delays like Saturday and Thursday according to the solution that I have developed.

b)Minneapolis-St Paul of SkyWest Airline has the highest delay which I have obtained in the airline(data frame) and the Portland Jetport of United Airline has an average of 64.00000000 is the most delayed destination that was prone to delays. So we have to focus on these particular destinations and airlines as they were causing major delays.

c)Using Mean for monthly flight delays calculation is optimum because the data is quite significant around the mean value and The company has to focus on the month of July as it was causing major delays.

d)South Region has the better ontime for departed flights which I have done from the dep_delay column and categorized them as OnTime and Delayed and used that data frame to work on and found that South has the highest onTime and SouthWest has the least. So they have to focus on the southwest as their majority base region is from the South if they can increase the productivity there it will help the company’s future.

e)From the scatterplot we cant observe any proper evidence to state that the taxi_out time has an effect on flight delays the graph is neither linear nor non-linear to judge.

f)When it comes to the Airline the most used one tends to be the United Airlines though it is the most delayed airline people are choosing this the reasons may be the availability and cost of the ticket may be less for these airlines.

g)SanFransisco is the destination airport that tended to be the most visited airport city from IAD.

h)Flight Number 1972 of United Airlines delayed the most with the count of 95 and the next following flight was flight number 356 of JetBlue and third 822 of United delayed the most.

Conclusion:

The company has to develop some mitigating measures for Flight number 1972 and United Airlines as they were the major reasons for the increase in delay they have to take some counter measures in order to mitigate them. And on every Saturday proper measures have to be taken in order to lessen the delay, Last but not least the major reason for flight delays is not the busy schedule day or holidays season like November but the days and months in which there are no occasions or less travel is having the highest delay time. So the company has to look at all these recommendations and implement them in their new policy schemes to decrease the delays at the airport /.
